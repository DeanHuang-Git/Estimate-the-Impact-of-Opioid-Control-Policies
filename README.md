# Estimate the Impact of Opioid Control Policies

## Abstract
Over the past two decades, prescription opioid addiction and overdose deaths, resulting from the
increased prescription and abuse of opioids pain medication, has wreaked havoc on communities
across the Unites States. These problems have become one of the most pressing health concerns
in the country. To decrease the severity of the problem at hand, many states have begun
implementing policies with the goal of restricting the flow of prescription opioids. The goal of this
analysis is to estimate the effectiveness of three such policy interventions implemented in Florida,
Texas, and Washington state. To assess the effectiveness of each policy, the per capita volume of
prescription opioids imported, and the per capita volume of fatal drug overdoses will be examined
using Pre-Post Comparison and Difference-in-Difference analyses.
